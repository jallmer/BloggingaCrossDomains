My name is Jens Allmer. I am a [Medical Informatics and Bioinformatics Professor at the Hochschule Ruhr West, University of Applied Sciences in Germany]( https://www.hochschule-ruhr-west.de/en/personenseiten/jens-allmer). I studied biology at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en), the [University of Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en), and [UPenn](https://www.upenn.edu). My academic backgrounds include biology, computer science, and some medicine. Checkout [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=allmer%2c+jens), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=bhfsiqeaaaaj), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/jens-allmer) for my track record.

However, this blog is separate from my role as a professor, although I may refer my students here for further information. 

Sometimes, I obsess over topics within and outside my academic background, and this is precisely what you will find on this blog. I will keep it simple so anyone can follow my relatively unfiltered stream of thoughts. Leave a comment if you have a question or find something puzzling or inaccurate.
