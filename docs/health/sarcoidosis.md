Worldwide, this disease is relatively uncommon ranging from 1 to 80 cases per 100,000 people. The relationship to vitamin D is that in this condition large amounts of [Calcitriol](calcitriol) are produced bypassing the typical regulation controls.

****Sarcoidosis**** is an inflammatory disease where granulomas (small clusters of immune cells) form in various organs, particularly the lungs and lymph nodes. In sarcoidosis, activated macrophages in these granulomas can convert [Calcifediol](calcifediol) to its active form, [Calcitriol](calcitriol), independent of the body’s D3 regulation. This can lead to **hypercalcemia** (elevated calcium levels) and hypercalciuria (elevated calcium in urine). Hypercalcemia is an often cited reason for vitamin D toxicity. Clearly, in this case sarcoidosis is too blame and not vitamin D since the disease bypasses the regulatory mechanisms.

So in sarcoidosis [Calcitriol](calcitriol) is elevated and probably [Calcifediol](calcifediol) is low since the conversion is performed by the activated macrophages. With high [Calcitriol](calcitriol), calcium is efficiently extracted from food. Even if the hormone Calcitonin which should lower [Calcitriol](calcitriol) levels is activated, the macrophages continue to convert the available [Calcifediol](calcifediol) to [Calcitriol](calcitriol). In order to combat hypercalcemia under these condition, the following two steps seem critical.

- Reduce the calcium intake as much as possible.
- Do not supplement with large doses of [Cholecalciferol](calciol). Rather supplement as much as would be needed on a daily basis.
- Check both [Calcifediol](calcifediol) and [Calcitriol](calcitriol) levels frequently so that the amount of supplementation can be adjusted correctly ([Gianella et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.12703/b/9-14)).

Since [Calcitriol](calcitriol) is involved in a large number of processes in the body, it is essential for our health and well being. Therefore, we cannot just not have [Calcitriol](calcitriol) (the first proof of that was rickets disease). In sarcoidosis, we cannot rely on measuring [Calcifediol](calcifediol) levels as we would do in healthy individuals. This is because of the uncontrolled conversion of [Calcifediol](calcifediol) to [Calcitriol](calcitriol) in the activated macrophages. This means we need to ensure constant sufficient amounts of [Cholecalciferol](calciol) that is converted to [Calcifediol](calcifediol) and then [Calcitriol](calcitriol) but not too much to induce hypercalcemia. [Calcium](calcium) avoidance will make this process easier.
