<div class="abstract">
[Vitamin D](vitamin-d), also known as calcitriol in its active form, is produced in the kidneys and helps the body absorb calcium, among other important functions like supporting the immune system. It is made from another form of vitamin D (calcifediol) and is carefully regulated to keep its levels in check. While calcitriol is the active form, itâ€™s not a good indicator of overall vitamin D storage in the body. Instead, vitamin D levels in storage are better measured by checking calcifediol levels. Some diseases, like sarcoidosis, can cause too much active vitamin D, while others, like chronic kidney disease, can prevent enough from being made.

The name **Calcitriol** (aka vitamin D) refers to a hormone that is produced via hydroxylation of [Calcifediol](calcifediol) in the human liver. **Calcitriol** is typically bound by the D-binding protein (DBP) but has a lower affinity DBP than [Calcifediol](calcifediol) but higher than [Cholecalciferol](calciol). **Calcitriol** is the active form of the hormone and facilitates calcium uptake among a myriad of other functions, such as immune system-related ones.

Chemical structure of **Calcitriol**


Chemical structure of **Calcitriol**. [Cholecalciferol](calciol) is only hydroxylated in position three, whereas [Calcifediol](calcifediol) is also hydroxylated in position 25. **Calcitriol** has three hydroxyl groups attached (positions 1, 3, and 25).

**Calcitriol** is produced by hydroxylation of [Calcifediol](calcifediol) in the kidney. Since **Calcitriol** is the active form of the hormone, its levels must be controlled. There is a self-regulation that down-regulates **Calcitriol** levels when they become high. **Calcitriol** is also under the control of the Parathyroid hormone.

**Calcitriol** is not a good marker for vitamin D sufficiency since it can be in a normal range while overall storage ([Calcifediol](calcifediol)) is low. However, it is important to confirm that **Calcitriol** can be produced or it must be supplemented as in kidney disease where the conversion to **Calcitriol** may be hampered.

Please note, that the ranges are in picogram and pico mole unlike [Calcifediol](calcifediol) which has much higher levels in the nanogram and nano mole range.

The much lower amount of **Calcitriol** compared to [Calcifediol](calcifediol) supports the idea that [Calcifediol](calcifediol) acts as storage and is converted to **Calcitriol** when needed. Diseases such as sarcoidosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) disturb this process and lead to too much (sarcoidosis) or too little (CKD) conversion.
