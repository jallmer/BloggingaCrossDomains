<div class="abstract">
[Vitamin D](vitamin-d), also called calcifediol (the short-term storage form), is made in the liver from another form of vitamin D. It usually binds to a protein in the blood, which helps it stay in the body for weeks. If there's not enough of this protein, vitamin D can be broken down and removed from the body through the kidneys. When the body needs more of the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol), especially for things like low calcium or immune system support, stored vitamin D is quickly converted.  
[Vitamin D](vitamin-d) levels in the blood can indicate if someone has a deficiency or not. If levels are too low (see table below), the body may struggle to make enough active vitamin D, leading to various diseases.

The name **Calcifediol** (aka vitamin D) refers to a hormone that is produced via hydroxylation of [Cholecalciferol](calciol) in the human liver. **Calcifediol** is typically bound to the D-binding protein (DBP) but can be unbound if there is not enough DBP. If unbound, it is typically degraded and excreted via the kidneys. When bound to DBP, **Calcifediol** is relatively stable and can circulate in the human blood for weeks. Unless it is converted to [Calcitriol](calcitriol) and used by downstream processes. If demand for [Calcitriol](calcitriol) is high, e.g., low calcium or challenges to the immune system, 'stored' **Calcifediol** is converted to [Calcitriol](calcitriol) quicker.

Chemical structure of **Calcifediol**


Chemical structure of **Calcifediol**. **Calcifediol** has a hydroxy group in position 25 where [Cholecalciferol](calciol) only has a hydrogen atom. This conversion typically happens in the human liver. Muscle cells can also perform this conversion, though.

Guidelines for **Calcifediol** levels in the blood and their clinical interpretation. Alternative explanations are given in the cited studies. The guidelines assume toxicity above 50 ng/ml. I personally side with the studies below and other studies that show higher blood levels without toxicity.

**Calcifediol** levels don't refer to the active form of the hormone which is [Calcitriol](calcitriol). However, with low levels of **Calcifediol**, the conversion to [Calcitriol](calcitriol) may be hampered, and the resulting levels of [Calcitriol](calcitriol) will also be low. Hence, **Calcifediol** is a good marker for the sufficiency of vitamin D in the human body.

In addition to **Calcifediol**, [Calcitriol](calcitriol) should also be measured in diseases where the conversion from calcifediol to [Calcitriol](calcitriol) is out of control. Examples are sarcoidosis, where too much [Calcitriol](calcitriol) is produced, and conditions like chronic kidney disease, where the conversion to calcitriol is often hampered, leading to lower levels of the active form of vitamin D.
