Do I get enough D3? Let's delve into this question, but first, read the delineation of the vitamin D terminology so that you can understand the terms [Cholecalciferol](calciol), [Calcifediol](calcifediol), and [Calcitriol](calcitriol), three different molecules collectively referred to as vitamin D.

**Are you sunbathing?**

The human skin produces Cholecalcferol if it contains 7-dehydrocholesterol and is irradiated with ultraviolet type B (UVB; 280-350nm) at the same time. The skin protects itself with Melanin against UVB damage. So, there is a trade-off between how long you can sunbathe and how much [Cholecalciferol](calciol) you can produce. The darker your tan (the more Melanin your skin contains), the less [Cholecalciferol](calciol) you can produce with the same amount of UVB since Melanin is your natural sunblock. Speaking of sunblock, when applying sunscreen, you effectively stop [Cholecalciferol](calciol) production because of it. On the other hand, the less Melanin your skin contains, the faster you get a sunburn. You definitely want to avoid burning for many reasons! You also want to produce [Cholecalciferol](calciol) so you need to expose as much skin to strong irradiation but ensure to stop well before you develop a sunburn.

How much [Cholecalciferol](calciol) you can produce in the time you spend sunbathing depends not only on your skin complexion but also on the level of UVB radiation. How much skin you expose to the sun is another factor. This leads to a complex estimation problem.

Here is a crude calculator to estimate the amount of [Cholecalciferol](calciol) you produce.

**How strong is the sun where you live?**

The strength of UVB irradiation is not the same everywhere. Ever heard of [blue zones](http://bluezones.com)? They are typically located in areas with high UVB, either in places that are sunny year-round or in places of higher altitudes, which also have an increased amount of UVB irradiation. The further away you get from the equator, the lower the amount of UVB irradiation. Additionally, in the winter, you get so little sun in the temperate areas that you might not produce any [Cholecalciferol](calciol). Also, you may wear protective clothing against the cold, which would further decrease the amount of [Cholecalciferol](calciol) that your body may be able to produce. While all the alleged differences between [blue zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_zone) and the areas we mere mortals live in are probably impacting health- and lifespan, I argue that vitamin D sufficiency, which is not on those lists, is likely the most important factor.

**[Vitamin D](vitamin-d) from Food**

[Vitamin D](vitamin-d) is produced by our skin in response to UVB radiation, and we can also get it from our food. Plant sources for vitamin D3 are unavailable because plants produce a slightly different molecule called Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Animals produce [Cholecalciferol](calciol) (vitamin D3). However, the D3 amounts we get from food are low compared to what can be made in the human skin under the right conditions. Animals also need the vitamin D system, so why would it be that we don't get enough from food sources? For one, many animals raised for food don't see much sunlight either and are deficient in D3. If they are not, we don't usually consume their blood in significant amounts, but the blood would be the major source of D3. Fat can be used for D3 storage, but that usually happens in times of D3 surplus, so the animal must have had enough D3 in its system to store it in fat. More details on this in another post. For now, it should suffice that fatty fish might be our best bet to get vitamin D3 from food.

**[Vitamin D](vitamin-d) from Supplements**

[Vitamin D](vitamin-d) was discovered by analyzing the sickness rickets (soft, weak bones in children). It was also discovered that a very small amount of vitamin D (400 IU) was enough to 'cure' the disease. There were no DXA scans during the Industrial Revolution, so it was not found that although the disease was cured to the eye, the bones were still weaker than they should have been. This and other bad decisions together caused the currently recommended very low dietary allowance (RDA). The allowance varies with age but is between 400 and 800 IU D3. Use the unit converter to see what that means in micrograms and the calculator for D3 production in your skin to get a feeling of how much you would produce under good sun exposure conditions. One cannot but wonder why the RDA value hasn't been adjusted. But wait, there is alleged D3 toxicity, so we should not consume high amounts. Without being a medical doctor, anyone with the ability to reason must understand that the amount of D3 that humans can produce in their skin, plus some small dietary intake, cannot be toxic since we wouldn't then exist as a species (stay tuned for my review paper on [Vitamin D](vitamin-d) Toxicity scheduled for early 2025).

Before we turn to supplements, the above needed to be clarified. You can buy many supplements, ranging from providing less than the RDA to providing 40 times the RDA in a single drop. I am not affiliated with any such supplement providers and will not point you to any specific supplement. So, the only information that is needed is that you should make sure the supplement is [Cholecalciferol](calciol) and that it comes from a trustworthy source since dietary supplements are not tested as rigorously as drugs. You would want to get approximately what it declares on the label.

One more piece of information may be interesting if you have large fat deposits. Dietary D3 is not absorbed by directly binding to D-binding protein and then entering the activation system. Instead, it is bound by chylomicrons, which transport the [Cholecalciferol](calciol) (D3) preferentially to fat and muscle cells. This may mean that you have to use a higher dose of the supplement to affect your blood D3 levels (make sure to be checked regularly, e.g., every 3 months, and target your [Calcifediol](calcifediol) levels for measurement). How does the D3 stored in your fat affect your health? It doesn't. Only if the fat is metabolized (you burn fat) is the stored D3 released, and then you should probably be more worried about the amount of saturated fat that is being released than the small amounts of D3.

**D3 Storage Sytems**

There are two main storage systems for D3. One that stores [Cholecalciferol](calciol) and the other [Calcifediol](calcifediol).

**D3 Storage in Fat**

My theory is that in surplus production of D3 in the skin (think evolutionary, not modern times), the surpluses that were not bound by D-binding protein and used in the body could partially migrate to the fat deposits under our skin and be stored there for times of scarcity. This is not likely to be important in areas around the equator, but when humans invaded temperate areas, this likely proved essential. On the one hand, less melanin (fairer skin) was an advantage, which led to higher D3 production in the skin. Another potential advantage could have been to be able to increase one's body fat levels before the onset of winter and fill them up with D3. This fat-stored D3 could then be released over the period of scarcity (sun/food) to provide energy and the important D3 hormone. While this theory is plausible to me, not all parts have been shown experimentally, so it remains a theory in parts.

D3 is, however, stored in our fat and released when this fat is burned. Fluctuations of D3 in and out of the fat cells, on the other hand, seem unlikely. Thus, D3 stored in fat presents a long-term storage system. Evolutionarily speaking on the order of months. Today, even on the order of decades.

As pointed out above, dietary D3 rather goes to fat and muscle cells than to the blood storage system (see below). Since D3 is fat soluble, it is directly stored in fat cells within lipid droplets. [[Cholecalciferol](calciol) and [Calcifediol](calcifediol) may be stored in fat cells](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2017-00650). Since D3 is stored in lipid droplets, there seems to be no directed mechanism to release D3 into the blood system other than via metabolizing the lipids. In our modern society, we typically hold on to our fat and don't go through annual cycles.
