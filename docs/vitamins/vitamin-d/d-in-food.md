Irradiated mushrooms, anyone?

**Animal-based Foods**

When considering vitamin D content in food, it's important to note that vitamin D is not naturally present in large quantities in most animal-derived foods, even though it is found in the blood and fat tissues of animals. While some foods like fatty fish (e.g., salmon, sardines, mackerel), eggs, and liver contain vitamin D3, these levels are still relatively low compared to what humans can produce through skin exposure to sunlight.

One interesting point is that while animals have vitamin D circulating in their blood, we typically do not consume this directly through eating or drinking. When we consume animal products, we are eating the muscle or fat, not blood. The vitamin D in the meat primarily comes from its fat content, not from the blood itself, even though blood does contain higher levels of vitamin D in living animals.

This differs from cultures that consume blood as part of their diet (such as blood sausage in certain regions), though even this is not a significant source of vitamin D because the amount of blood consumed is relatively small, and blood is generally not a major food component in modern diets.

Moreover, even if we were to consume animal blood, it still wouldn't provide a large or consistent enough source of vitamin D to meet human needs. Most vitamin D in animals is stored in their liver and fatty tissues, and this is where humans can get it from if they eat those specific parts. But again, this intake tends to be relatively modest compared to the amount of vitamin D the human body can synthesize from sunlight.
